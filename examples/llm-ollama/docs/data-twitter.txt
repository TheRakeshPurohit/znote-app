Twitter is an online social networking platform and microblogging service founded in 2006. It allows users to post and read short messages called "tweets", which are limited to 280 characters. Users can post tweets on a variety of topics, share links, images, videos, and interact with other users by commenting, retweeting, or liking their tweets.

Twitter is widely used to share news, opinions, thoughts, personal and professional information, as well as to follow public figures, brands, businesses, organizations and friends. It is used by millions of people around the world to stay informed about real-time events, to express themselves on topics of interest, to initiate conversations and to expand their professional and social networks.

Over the years, Twitter has become an important tool for citizen journalism, awareness campaigns, social mobilization, marketing and advertising. It has also been used to organize live events, online discussions, political debates and social movements. Twitter is available on the web as well as mobile apps for use on smartphones and tablets.
